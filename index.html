<p><dd><img src="images/spbullet.gif" width=77 height=45>Imagine racing downhill on a frictionless
board at breakneck speeds. Imagine going over huge jumps and dodging
sharp pointy things and large blunt objects in a race to the bottom, slamming
into other players on your way there, trying to get them to crash. Imagine
this, and you have Slide. It's just another one of those old Quake mods, but
people seem to enjoy it.

<tr><td><dd>Still alive! I'm pretty much done with Slide (thus, this site will no longer be updated save to keep it working), but who knows? Maybe I'll mod Slide into some other FPS someday. People seemed to enjoy this mod above all others I made. In the meantime play some SSX, people! (PS, I totally forgot that my download directory for years now has had a halfpipe level, and I never mentioned it! Enjoy :)

<strong>Slide in the news!</strong>
<br><dd><a href="mailto:roussin@genesis8.frmug.org">Emmanuel Roussin</a>
Sent me free of charge 4 French magazines for Griphis and myself just cause
they mentioned Slide. This really makes me all warm and fuzzy inside to
see my work up in print. I really gotta start doing Quake 2 and/or QuakeArena
patches.

<td>Your hoverboard. It's frictionless, and has no limit on top speed. You
get one when you run through the start point, or over a reslider. When you
turn, you still go in the same direction as you were before turning, but if
you hold the attack button as you turn, you can direct your velocity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center><img src="images/spoint.gif" width=262 height=154></td>
<td>This is the start point. They're always found at the tops of slide tracks,
and are floating while rotating slowly. Run through them to get a hoverboard
and begin the timer for your descent through the level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center><img src="images/cpoint.gif" width=128 height=179></td>
<td>This is a checkpoint. If these exist in a level, they NEED to be hit or
else you can't reach the end point. Be sure you don't miss your checkpoints.
You'll hear a tone and they'll light up when you run over them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center><img src="images/epoint.gif" width=174 height=193></td>
<td>This is (big suprise) the end point. Always found at the bottom of a
Slide track. Hit it to end the current run down the track, record your time
if it's the best, and get your five frags if you're playing in deathmatch. If
you DID run the course with the best time. you'll get seven frags instead of
the usual five.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center><img src="images/bonus.gif" width=155 height=196></td>
<td>These little hyper spinny things are the generic bonus item in Slide.
They're usually placed in awkward places, and if you manage to snag one,
you're rewarded with a frag.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center><img src="images/reslide.gif" width=181 height=146></td>
<td>This might look like a start point, but it's not. It's a reslide point.
Reslide points don't rotate, and are a little smaller than start points as
well as being latched to the ground. If you deactivate your hoverboard
halfway through the track, or somehow lose your board, run over one of these
to get brand spankin' new hoverboard.</td>
